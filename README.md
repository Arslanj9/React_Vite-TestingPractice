## Project Setup

This project was created using Vite for building a fast React application. We will use Vitest for running tests, React Testing Library for testing React components, and Jest-DOM to extend DOM-related matchers. Happy DOM is also included as an alternative DOM environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

## Testing Libraries

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the libraries we are using for testing:

- **Vitest**: A fast unit testing framework that works with Vite.
- **React Testing Library**: For rendering React components and interacting with them in a way that mimics how users would.
- **Jest-DOM**: Provides custom matchers for testing DOM elements more intuitively.
- **Happy DOM**: A fast, lightweight DOM implementation for Node.js environments (used internally by Vitest).
